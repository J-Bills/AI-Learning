Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations.<br/><br/>If you have time, I'd love it if you submit a PR for changes in the community_contributions folder - instructions in the resources.

       "The problem cannot yield a specific integer number of trips without knowing the flat monthly fee of the frequent rider pass (`P`) relative to the median fare (`F`). The answer depends on the ratio `P/F`.\n",

       "1.  **If trips are distributed 50% peak and 50% off-peak:**\n",

       "    The minimum number of trips is `floor((P/F) / 0.26875) + 1`.\n",
       "\n",
       "**How the answer changes:**\n",
       "As seen from the denominators (0.2625 vs 0.26875), a higher proportion of peak trips means the cost difference between individual tickets and pass-holder trips (per trip) is slightly larger. This implies that the pass becomes financially advantageous at a *slightly lower* number of total trips when more trips are taken during peak hours.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Example (to illustrate with an assumed Pass Fee):**\n",
       "Let's assume the monthly pass fee `P` is equivalent to the cost of **4 median base fares**, so `P/F = 4`.\n",

       "1.  **50% peak / 50% off-peak:**\n",
       "    `N > 4 / 0.2625 = 15.238...`\n",
       "    The minimum number of trips would be **16**.\n",

       "    The minimum number of trips would be **15**.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this example, shifting to more peak trips (75% vs 50%) makes the pass advantageous one trip sooner (15 trips vs 16 trips)."
